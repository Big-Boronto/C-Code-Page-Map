# C Code Page Map

A quick mapping of the "C" code page, containing the relevant UTF-8 codepoints, integer values, and character names for each character. The file [C Code Page Map](https://github.com/Red-K0/C-Code-Page-Map/blob/main/C%20Code%20Page%20map.md) contains the map, while the file [C Code Page Raw Data](https://github.com/Red-K0/C-Code-Page-Map/blob/main/C%20Code%20Page%20Raw%20Data.txt) contains the raw info for each character sequentially.
